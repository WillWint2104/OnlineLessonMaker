## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Dev tooling baseline (not part of the single-file app): `package.json` (dev-only
  `playwright`), `scripts/shots.mjs` (theme × slide screenshot harness),
  `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml` (informational PR artifact, non-gating),
  `.github/pull_request_template.md`, this changelog, and `docs/CHECKING.md`.

## Baseline — verified state at bootstrap (2026-06-20)

The single-file app (`lesson-studio.html`) carrying:

- **Three modes:** Study (student view), Edit (in-place authoring), Present (full-screen
  board mode — click / arrow-key navigation, no nav bar).
- **Slide types:** cover, outcomes (with NSW Syllabus Links popup), notes (with
  `==marker==` "record this" reveal toggle), image, video, question, source
  (text / image+hotspots / model3d), model3d, artifact, worksheet, external, complete.
  (`task` is dormant — render branch + factory retained, removed from the Add menu/seed.)
- **Interactive hotspots** on source images — percentage-positioned dots, `tooltip` /
  `window` / `video` kinds, drag-to-place in Edit mode.
- **Four topic themes** plus neutral: `egypt`, `rome`, `wellbeing`, `ww1` — swapped via
  `data-theme` on `<html>` (`setTheme`), pure CSS custom properties (palette, display
  font, corner radius, hero gradient, motif).
- **Stateless by design:** no backend, no database, no `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`;
  state is the file, persisted via Export (standalone study-mode `.html`).
- **CI:** `scripts/validate.mjs` gates on valid engine JS + parseable lesson JSON and
  warns on storage / third-party hosts.

Known follow-ups (see `HANDOFF.md` §9 roadmap): vendor fonts + model-viewer for school
firewalls, WW1 design pass, accessibility pass, decide the dormant `task` type.
